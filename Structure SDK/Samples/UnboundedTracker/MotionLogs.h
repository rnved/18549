/**
MotionLogs demonstrates how to record and export tracker motion.
There are two types of tracker motion we may be interested in:
- Motion of the camera relative to the game world
- Motion of the tracker relative to the real world

Game motion is out-of-sync from real world motion because of movements in the game world that aren't reflected in the real world, e.g:
  - panning & warping
  - running into (game) walls
  - we exaggerate horizontal motion 2.5x relative to vertical motion
  
We output game camera motion as a basic csv format, to [DATE]GameCameraPoses.log. These will be loaded on startup for replay.
  
We output tracker motion in the .dae format, to [DATE]WorldCameraPoses.dae. This can be loaded in an external 3D editor such as MODO or Maya as a camera path. 
 
Both Motion logs are accessible from iTunes Files Sharing.
