    /*  iOS 9.2+ introduced unexpected behavior: every time a Structure Sensor is
     plugged in to iOS, iOS will launch all Structure SDK apps in the background.
     The apps will not be visible to the user.  This can cause problems since
     Structure SDK apps typically ask the user for permission to use the camera
     when launched.  This leads to the user's first experience with a Structure
     SDK app being:
     1.  Download Structure SDK apps from App Store
     2.  Plug in Structure Sensor to iPad
     3.  Get bombarded with "X app wants to use the Camera" notifications from
         every installed Structure SDK app
     
     Each app has to deal with this problem in its own way.  In the Structure SDK,
     sample apps peacefully exit without causing a crash report.  This also
     has other benefits, such as not using memory.  Note that Structure SDK does
     not support connecting to Structure Sensor if the app is in the background. */
